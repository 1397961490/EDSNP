# EDSNP  (Algorithm for) Edge Detection Based on an SN P System

The structure and functioning of this algorithm is descirbed in: 
Luping Zhang,  Fei Xu,  Ferrante Neri. Communication in Spiking Neural Membrane Systems and its Use in Edge Detection, under review, 2024.

The tp(num),  tn(num), fp(num), and fn(num) correspond to TP (True Positive), TN (True Negative), FP (False Positive),  and FN (False Negative).

First, install the Matlab-2018a.

Second,  download the images and the groundtruths from the databases,  such as BSD500,  PASCAL VOC,  BIPED databases.

Third,  change the loading path (in line 24) to the chosen image storage path,  and change the loading path (in line 15) to the corresponding groundtruth storage path.

Finally,  click the program file to run.
